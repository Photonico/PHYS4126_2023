### (a)

In the orthorhombic crystal, the primitive lattice vectors of the direct and reciprocal lattices can be written as follows:

The direct primitive lattice vectors are:
$$ a_1 = 2i $$
$$ a_2 = 3j $$
$$ a_3 = 5k $$

Where $i$, $j$, $k$ are unit vectors along the $x$, $y$, $z$ directions respectively.

The reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated using the following formula:

$$b_1 = 2\pi(a_2 \times a_3) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$
$$b_2 = 2\pi(a_3 \times a_1) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$
$$b_3 = 2\pi(a_1 \times a_2) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$

In this case, as the direct primitive lattice vectors are along the coordinate axes, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be simplified as:

$$b_1 = 2\pi/a_1 $$
$$b_2 = 2\pi/a_2 $$
$$b_3 = 2\pi/a_3 $$

It is worth noting that the units of the reciprocal lattice vectors are 1/Angstrom, which is different from the Angstrom units of the direct lattice.

### (b)

The wavevector $k$ at the first Brillouin zone boundary corresponds to the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In an orthorhombic crystal with lattice parameters $a$, $b$, $c$:

For the $[010]$ direction, the corresponding reciprocal vector will have a magnitude of $\pi/b$. Therefore, the wavevector at the boundary in this direction will be $k = \pi/b$ (in units of inverse Angstroms).

Similarly, for the $[110]$ direction, the magnitude of the corresponding reciprocal vector will be $\pi/\sqrt(a^2+b^2)$, so the wavevector will be $k = \pi/\sqrt(a^2+b^2)$.

For the $[111]$ direction, the reciprocal vector will have a magnitude of $\pi/\sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2)$, thus the wavevector will be $k = \pi/\sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2)$.

We have:
$$ E_c = 0.7\left[\frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{2}sin^2\left(\frac{k_x a}{2}\right) \right] $$
$$ E_v = 0.6[cos(k_x a)-1] $$

For an orthorhombic crystal, the group velocity of electrons in the conduction band can be calculated by taking the derivative of the energy E with respect to the wavevector k:

$$ v_g = \frac{1}{\hbar}\frac{{\mathrm d}E}{{\mathrm d}k} $$

In the given E_c, we can take the derivative with respect to $k_x$. Considering the known lattice constant a, we obtain:

$$ \frac{{\mathrm d}E_c}{{\mathrm d}k_x} = -0.7a\sin(k_xa)\cos(k_xa) $$

At $k_x = 0$, the group velocity $v_g = 0$ (since both sin and cos are 0 at this point).

At $k_x = pi/(2a)$, inserting into the above expression, as $\cos(\pi/2) = 0$ and $\sin(\pi/2) = 1$, we get:

$\frac{{\mathrm d}E_c}{{\mathrm d}k_x} = 0$

Thus, the group velocity of electrons in the conduction band is 0 at both $k_x = 0$ and $k_x = \pi/(2a)$.

### （a）

The basis for the perovskite structure of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) consists of four atoms: one Sr atom, one Ti atom, and three O atoms.

In terms of lattice coordinates, we could represent the positions as follows:

Sr is at the corner of the cube, its position can be given as $(0, 0, 0)$.
Ti is at the center of the cube, its position can be given as $(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.
O atoms are in the center of each face of the cube, their positions can be given as $(1/2, 1/2, 0)$, $(1/2, 0, 1/2)$, and $(0, 1/2, 1/2)$.

### (b)

The X-ray structure factor (F) can be calculated from the following formula:

$$ F = \sum f_j\exp(2\pi i(hu_j + kv_j + lw_j)) $$
