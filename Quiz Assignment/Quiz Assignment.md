### (a)

In the orthorhombic crystal, the primitive lattice vectors of the direct and reciprocal lattices can be written as follows:

The direct primitive lattice vectors are:
$$ a_1 = 2i $$
$$ a_2 = 3j $$
$$ a_3 = 5k $$

Where $i$, $j$, $k$ are unit vectors along the $x$, $y$, $z$ directions respectively.

The reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated using the following formula:

$$b_1 = 2\pi(a_2 \times a_3) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$
$$b_2 = 2\pi(a_3 \times a_1) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$
$$b_3 = 2\pi(a_1 \times a_2) / (a₁\cdot(a_2 \times a_3))$$

In this case, as the direct primitive lattice vectors are along the coordinate axes, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be simplified as:

$$b_1 = 2\pi/a_1 $$
$$b_2 = 2\pi/a_2 $$
$$b_3 = 2\pi/a_3 $$

It is worth noting that the units of the reciprocal lattice vectors are 1/Angstrom, which is different from the Angstrom units of the direct lattice.
