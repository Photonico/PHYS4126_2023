In an infinite one-dimensional chain, the dispersion relation, given by $\omega = \sqrt{4K/M} |\sin(ka/2)|$, describes the relationship between wave number and frequency. As M increases, the dispersion curve flattens. The sound velocity, the speed at which sound waves propagate in the material, can be obtained from the slope of the dispersion relation at the long wave limit, given by $v = \sqrt{K/M}$.

The energy gap of ZnSe is $2.3 \mathrm{eV}$. corresponding to a wavelength range of about $400$ to $750$ nm, The energy range of visible light is approximately $1.65$ to $3.1 \mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, ZnSe is transparent to visible light because its energy gap is smaller than the maximum energy of visible light.
