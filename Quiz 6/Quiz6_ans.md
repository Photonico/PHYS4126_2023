### (a)

Doping silicon with arsenic creates an n-type semiconductor. This is because arsenic has five valence electrons, one more than silicon, and the extra electron is free to move within the crystal, providing an additional charge carrier. Since the extra carrier is an electron, which is negatively charged, the semiconductor is termed as n-type.

### (b)

For an n-type semiconductor are fully ionized at room temperature ($300 {\rm K}$). The each arsenic atoms given as $n_{\rm As} = 10^{17} {\rm cm^{-3}}$ offersone electron when ionized.

So, the free carrier concentration ($n$) for the majority carriers, which are electrons in this case, is also $n=10^{17} {\rm cm^{-3}}=10^{23} {\rm m^{-3}}$.

### (c)

The fermi energy is given by:

$$ E_F = E_C - k_BT\ln{\frac{N_C}{n}} $$

where, $E_C$ is the energy at the bottom of the conduction band, for Si $E_C \approx 0$;

$N_C$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band;

$n$ is the electron concentration which is equal to the arsenic atom concentration $10^{17} {\rm cm^{-3}}$.

$$ N_C = 2 (2\pi m_ek_BT/\hbar^2)^{3/2}$$

We arrive:
$$ E_F = -1.3928 {\rm eV} $$

In an n-type semiconductor, the Fermi level (chemical potential) is closer to the conduction band due to the presence of extra free electrons.

a: $1E−4$: This is a small, positive value, suggesting that material a is paramagnetic.

b: $2E5$: This is a large, positive value, suggesting that material b is ferromagnetic.

c: $−3E-5$: This is a negative value, suggesting that material c is diamagnetic.
