### (a)

Doping silicon with arsenic creates an n-type semiconductor. This is because arsenic has five valence electrons, one more than silicon, and the extra electron is free to move within the crystal, providing an additional charge carrier. Since the extra carrier is an electron, which is negatively charged, the semiconductor is termed as n-type.

### (b)

For an n-type semiconductor are fully ionized at room temperature ($300 {\rm K}$). The each arsenic atoms given as $n_{\rm As} = 10^{17} {\rm cm^{-3}}$ offersone electron when ionized.

So, the free carrier concentration ($n$) for the majority carriers, which are electrons in this case, is also $n=10^{17} {\rm cm^{-3}}$.

### (c)



In an n-type semiconductor, the Fermi level (chemical potential) is closer to the conduction band due to the presence of extra free electrons. However, the exact position of the Fermi level with respect to the conduction band requires complex calculations involving variables like temperature, the Boltzmann constant, the effective density of states in the conduction band, and the electron concentration.

### (d)
